Ship Service Program for CargoMate!

This program is used entirely through the command line/console.

Run the program and follow the command line instructions.
Enter:
1 - Print all the ship
2 - Enter an ID to print a specific ship
3 - Enter an owner to print a list of ships owned by them (owner must entered without quotation marks)

The program only handles one input per run so to chose a new option the program must be restarted.
